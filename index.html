        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img src="me.jpg"><br>
         <p>Hello my name is Nicole, I am 27 years old and I have recently relocated from New Jersey to Alpharetta Georgia. Over the past 8 years I have tinkered in tech and I now plan to turn my passion into a career. I am a highly driven, organized and well mannered person with knack for problem solving. My positive attitude and infectious personality guarantee to be a valued addition to the team. I always strive to provide high quality products on or prior to deadline dates, listening to customer's unique requirements or issues and producing custom solutions based upon their specific needs.</p>
<h4>Hobbies</h4>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy a wide variety of activities which include;  horseback riding, reading, painting, quilting, bowling, playing instruments(violin, piano, flute and guitar) and fishing!</p>
<br><h4>How Did It All Begin?</h4>
<p>My passion for computers first started when I was around 9 years old and noticed my first computer had been infected with a severe virus that took control of my cursor and immediately navigated it to close any browser window I tried to open!! Frustrated with the helplessness of not being able to control MY own computer I began taking it apart to physically see if I could find and fix the problem...Obviously with no luck I began researching what the problem could possibly be during Free-Time at school. Eventually learning about hardware vs software and how it they worked in tandem I performed a (what I now know is the lazy way out) complete system reset, but hey, to me it was still a victory! From there I was hooked and wanted to learn all I could about computers and technology in general!</p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>From the years of 2014 to 2016 I exercised my talents as a Freelance Web Developer specializing in building and maintaining responsive web sites as well as developing small web based applications for local trucking companies. In that time I would repair, build, personalize and provide virus removal services for desktops and laptops. Offered on-site pc maintenance, screen repairs, software and network configuration and software/hardware upgrades. On occasion I consulted with customers on a variety of computer related issues along with offering desktop support via phone and/or screen share software.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>From 2009 until 2011 I attended Westwood College, majoring in Software Development and Video Game Design. Unfortunately I was only able to obtain 60 credits towards my bachelors degree before I was forced to resign due to a lack of funds. However, still passionate about the field I began the road to self-education reading, attending local user group meetings, signing up for any software code camps and Hack-A-Thons I could in order to hone my abilities. Since I have never worked in a structured company my next goal is to complete an internship an attempt to gain proper field experience. </p>

Goals

What's the end game? I would love the opportunity to develop my skills in a mid to large sized company receiving structure and the chance to hone my abilities, in time being able to share my knowledge and experience to assist the progression of my peers.

In the near future elevating my occupation to Full Stack Developer and eventually receiving my PHD in Computer Science.
